## üèó Getting Started with Development

1. clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CrossPaste/crosspaste-desktop.git
   ```

2. Compile and run the application

   ```bash
   cd crosspaste-desktop
   ./gradlew composeApp:run
   ```
   
First start will download [JBR](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsRuntime) / gradle dependencies.

If you encounter the following error:
```log
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
> java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
```
you might need a VPN to download these dependencies.

To configure a proxy for gradle, add the following settings to [gradle.properties](./gradle.properties), and adjust the parameters to match your proxy configuration:
```properties
systemProp.https.proxyHost=localhost
systemProp.https.proxyPort=8080
systemProp.https.proxyUser=userid
systemProp.https.proxyPassword=password
systemProp.http.nonProxyHosts=*.nonproxyrepos.com|localhost
```

Additionally, a series of technical [blogs](https://crosspaste.com/en/blog/introduction) about CrossPaste is being published (approximately one article per week). If you're interested in developing cross-platform applications, you're welcome to read them.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap
CrossPaste is continuously evolving! We plan to add more useful features in future versions. Here's an overview of our near-term development plans:

**As seen in the changelog, recent versions have included numerous PRs focused on refactoring and labeled with "multiplatform". Indeed, we are actively working towards launching a mobile version. These efforts are laying the groundwork for mobile support. Therefore, before the mobile version is released, we will only be focusing on bug fixes and a limited number of already-planned new features.**

- [x] **v1.0.12**: Support for RTF format in pasteboard
- [x] **v1.0.13**: Support for color data in pasteboard
- [ ] **v1.1.0**: Support for mobile devices and shared pasteboard with mobile
- [ ] **v1.2.0**: Support for native pasteboard, improve pasteboard performance
- [ ] **v1.3.0**: Introduction of command-line mode

This is just a small part of our plans. Want to learn more details and long-term plans? Check out our [full roadmap](doc/en/Roadmap.md).
