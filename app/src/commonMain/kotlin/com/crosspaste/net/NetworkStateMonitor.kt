/**
 * Observes real OS network state so the discovery layer can self-heal.

 * The JVM exposes no callback for interface up/down, IP changes, or reachability,
 * so platform implementations bridge native events (e.g. macOS `NWPathMonitor`,
 * Windows IP Helper / Network List Manager, Linux RTNETLINK) into [networkChanges].
 *
 * Each emission means "something about the network changed" — it carries no payload;
 * consumers re-read the current interface snapshot themselves. Emissions may be
 * coalesced/debounced by the implementation or the consumer.
