# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

# [1.1.2] - 2025-5-1
## Highlights 🌟

- 🔄 **Migrated from Realm to SQLite (SQLDelight) — Breaking Change:**  
  We've officially transitioned from Realm to SQLDelight for data persistence. Since Realm is no longer actively maintained, this change was essential for long-term project sustainability, better multiplatform support, and open tooling integration.  
  ⚠️ **Important:** Due to differences in storage structure, this is a **non-backward-compatible** migration. Pasteboard data from previous versions will **not be visible** in the new version. However, your old data has **not been deleted** — it's still safely stored in the previous Realm database files.

- 📱 **Android Version Under Review:**
  The Android version of CrossPaste is currently under review on Google Play. A corresponding changelog will be released when it's officially available.

- 📤📥 **Import & Export Support for Pasteboard:**  
  You can now import and export your pasteboard data, making backups, transfers, and marketing scenarios much more flexible and powerful.

- 🔁 **Fully Shared `commonMain` Logic with Mobile Platforms:**  
  Core logic is now truly multiplatform. We've refactored platform-specific code to maximize reuse across desktop and mobile environments, simplifying future feature rollouts and bug fixes.

- 🎨 **Refreshed Logo and Branding:**  
  The app now features a modernized logo and consistent branding across platforms, including SVG-based rendering to ensure crisp display at any resolution.

- 🧩 **Multiple Fixes to Data Migration Logic:**  
  We've resolved several issues related to migration paths, including path resolution, cleanup logic, and data consistency across updates.
